Workout 01: GSW shot charts

This homework exercise is about the analysis of shots taken by basketball players. Specfically, we are focusing on the shots taken by the closing lineup of the Golden State Warriors from the 2016 season, otherwise known as the "Hampton 5," consisting of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant. 

The task of analyzing the shots taken involves several steps: 
The first step involves the data preparation. The raw data shots are downloaded and altered in order to create one large data table to contains all the data we need. We extract values such as the mintues into the game from analysis of the data values, and we also specify a name column. I also created a data dictionary to explain the various basketball terminology of the data variables. The first script takes in the initial data tables and outputs a combined data table with the shot information of all five players plus a summary of each individual player's shots. 

The second step involves the visualization of the data. By plotting the shots of each player over a background picture of the basketball course, we can visualize the shots taken by each player: the location, frequency and accuracy of each player from various locations on the basketball court. Finally for this step, I created a combined visual analysis of the lineup's shots. In this multi-graph image, we can compare the various shots taken by each of the players and see how the differ. 

The final step is preparing a report about the shooting statistics of the five GSW players. In this report, I prepare tables about the shooting percentages of the players and compare their shooting accuracy and volume. This report is a longer piece containing more background information about these players and the Golden State Warriors.

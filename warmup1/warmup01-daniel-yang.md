Star Wars Characters: **Jar Jar Binks**
=======================================

[Source: The Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks)

*Jar Jar Binks was a Gungan male military commander and politician who played a key role in the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once an outcast from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior, he regained favor with his people by helping secure an alliance between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, an alliance vital in ending the Trade Federation's invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that followed, Binks became a Junior Representative for his people in the Galactic Senate, serving alongside Amidala once she became the planet's senator.*

*Servings: 24 small fritters. Time: 30 minutes. [From Smitten Kitchen!](https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/07/corn-fritters/)*

A perfect side dish served at breakfast or dinner! Best done in the summer with fresh corn, which produces a more vibrant taste.

### Ingredients:

-   3 cups corn (6 fresh ears)
-   4 scallions
-   1/2 cup chopped chives
-   1 cup grated sharp cheddar
-   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (plus more to taste)
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   4 large eggs
-   1 cup all-purpose flour (plus 2 more tablespoons if needed)
-   Olive oil

### Misc. Kitchen Tools:

-   [Medium Scooper](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Medium-Cookie-Scoop/dp/B0000CDVD2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1531496857&sr=1-6&keywords=cookie+scoop&linkCode=sl1&tag=smitten-20&linkId=57d799f38cc949f8386459ff269fdf5e)
-   Flour sifter (or a strainer)
-   Flat spatula or spoon (for pressing fritters)

### Recipe:

1.  Chop chives and scallions, and grate cheese. Set aside.
2.  To extract the corn from the ear, shuck stand the stalk in a large bowl. Use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the corn into the bowl, then run the back of your knife up and down the stalk to release as much “milk” as possible into the bowl. Repeat with remaining ears.
3.  In the bowl, add chives, scallions, cheese, and several grinds of pepper. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if necessary.
4.  Add 4 eggs and stir with a fork/spoon until corn is well coated.
5.  Add 1 cup flour over the strainer. If a scoop of the mixture does not hold its shape, add 2 more tablespoons. At this point, the mixture should look like egg salad!
6.  Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in large frying pan over medium heat.
7.  Once oil is simmering, add first scoop of fritter batter and press down to create a disc shape.
8.  When the underside is a deep golden brown, flip and cook to the same color on the other side.
9.  Remove from oil and pat dry with a paper towel.
10. Once cooled, taste the fritter. Adjust seasonings of remaining batter accordingly.
11. Cook the remaining batter in the same fashion, and serve!

### Alternatives:

*There are many variations of this recipe that create delicious kinds of fritters! Try experimenting with your own flavors or use some of the following suggestions:*

-   Street corn-ish: Work some lime zest into the batter, use cotija cheese intead of cheddar, keep the scallions, and use cilantro for the herb. Finish with a shake of chili powder and sour cream.
-   Miso-scallion: Whisk 2 to 3 teaspoons white miso into the egg in the batter, skip the cheese, and double-down on the scallions.
-   Cacio e pepe: Skip the scallions and use parsley instead of chives. Add many many grinds of black pepper and sharp pecorino for the cheese.
-   Spiced: Try this with 1/4 cup minced red onion instead of scallions, cilantro instead of chives, and then add 1 teaspoon each ground coriander and cumin, 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric and cayenne or another red chili powder to taste. Finish with a cooling dollop of yogurt.

Wikipedia Article: **Euclidian Distance**
=========================================

### Definition

The **Euclidian distaince** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\ldots + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$$

$$ = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i - p\_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\|\\mathbf{p}\\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\ldots+ p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}},$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
